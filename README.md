# Arduino KeyCard NFC

## 1. Arduino

To get started with Arduino, follow these steps:

- Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) for your operating system.
- Arduino programming language is based on C and C++. It is more affordable than Raspberry Pi.

### Raspberry Pi vs. Arduino (Just example. Raspberry have so many version too.)

| Feature             | Raspberry Pi                              | Arduino                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Processor           | ARM Cortex-A72 quad-core                | Atmel ATmega328P          |
| Clock Speed         | 1.5GHz                                  | 16MHz                     |
| RAM                 | 1GB or more                             | 2KB or more               |
| Storage             | microSD card                            | None or microSD card      |
| Operating System    | Linux                                   | None                      |
| Programming Language| Python, C/C++, Java, etc                | Arduino programming language |
| Connectivity        | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth              | None or limited (Need extension) |

If you need to complete a big project and require a more powerful tool, Raspberry Pi might be a better choice. For smaller projects, you can start with Arduino. However, be aware of different hardware versions. You can learn more about them in the [Arduino Hardware](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware) documentation.

  
## 2.NFC
### NFC vs. RFID
| Feature             | NFC                                       | RFID                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Frequency           | High frequency (13.56 MHz)              | Wide range of frequencies (low, high, ultrahigh)|
| Range               | Up to 20 cm                             | Up to 100 m or more                             |
| Communication       | Two-way                                 | One-way or two-way                              |
| Cost                | Tags are relatively inexpensive         | Tags can be expensive                           |
