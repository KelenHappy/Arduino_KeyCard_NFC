### 1.Ardiuno  
  Just follow your OS and download [Ardiuno IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
  Ardiuno programming lamguage is based on C and C++. And it is more affordable than Raspberry Pi.
  | Feature             | Raspberry Pi                              | Arduino                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Processor           | ARM Cortex-A72 quad-core                | Atmel ATmega328P          |
| Clock Speed         | 1.5GHz                                  | 16MHz                     |
| RAM                 | 1GB or more                             | 2KB or more               |
| Storage             | microSD card                            | None or microSD card      |
| Operating System    | Linux                                   | None                      |
| Programming Language| Python, C/C++, Java, etc                | Arduino programming language |
| Connectivity        | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth              | None or limited (Need extension) |

 
  So, if you need to complete a big project and need more powerful tool. Raspberry Pi is a good choice.
  You can use Ardiuno to start a small project.But, there are some hardware version you need to know about [Ardiuno Hardware](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware).
